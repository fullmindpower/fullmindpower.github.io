			<section class="border-top border-2 mt-4 pt-3">
				<h2>What is The Prosperity Mind Game?</h2>
				<p>The <b>Prosperity Mind Game</b> is an improved <b>manifestation exercise</b> originally created by <b>Abraham Hicks</b> and is based on the principle of the <b>Law of Attraction</b>, which states that like attracts like. In other words, the energy we emit through our thoughts and feelings attracts corresponding experiences and outcomes into our lives. By shifting our focus from lack and scarcity to feelings of abundance and <b>gratitude</b>, we can effectively change the energy we emit and attract more prosperity and <b>financial abundance</b> into our lives.</p>
				<p>The game is designed to help you cultivate an abundant and <b>positive mindset</b>. It includes form of journaling, visualization exercises, affirmations, and other practices that help you focus on abundance and gratitude. By regularly participating in these exercises, you can train your mind to align with the vibration of abundance and attract more <b>prosperity</b> into your life.</p>
				<p>In addition to these exercises, the Prosperity Mind Game also encourages you to adopt an <b>abundance mindset</b> in your daily life. This may involve focusing on positive aspects of your life, counting your blessings, and engaging in activities that bring you joy and fulfillment. By doing so, you can cultivate a deep sense of gratitude and attract more abundance into your life.</p>
				<p>Overall, the <b>Prosperity Game</b> is a <b>powerful manifestation tool</b> that can help you attract greater prosperity and financial abundance into your life. By shifting your focus from lack and scarcity to feelings of abundance and gratitude, you can effectively align your thoughts and actions with the <b>vibration of abundance</b> and create a life filled with prosperity and abundance.</p>

				<h2>The Principle of the <span class="lfoseo">Prosperity </span>Game.</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>On the first day, you will receive a check for a certain amount of money. Since it is a game, it is all virtual, with no real money involved.
						<div class="row g-0 my-4 justify-content-center">
							<img class="img-fluid shadow col-12 col-sm-8 col-md-6" src="/media/prosperity-mind-game-paycheck.webp" alt="The Prosperity Mind Game Paycheck">
						</div>
					</li>
					<li>Your goal is to use all of that money on the very same day to buy things you want - again, virtually, in your imagination.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>You should make it as realistic as possible, for example, by searching for shops, looking for prices, and specifying details.</li>
							<li>You should only buy things for your personal use that bring you joy. You should not buy necessities or anything for others, donate to a charity, or give money away.</li>
							<li>Over the day, you should write down the list of things you have "purchased" until you have no money left.</li>
						</ul>
					<li>The next day, you will receive another check with an increased amount of money. Again, you have to use all of that money to buy anything you want.</li>
					<li>This will repeat for the duration of the game, which may be 21 or 42 days, or even longer, such as 365 days.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>How to Play the <span class="lfoseo">Prosperity Mind </span>Game.</h2>
				<p>When playing the Prosperity Game, it is necessary to keep records of your "purchases" in the form of a journal. Similarly to other manifestation techniques, such as scripting, it is suitable to make things physical. Although doing things on the computer or on your phone is acceptable, using a pen and paper adds more reality to the game.</p>
